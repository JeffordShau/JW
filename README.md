Project Description:


Our project is a text-based RPG. This RPG allows the player to fight monsters and use items. For each day, there are three random options: fight a monster, find a random amount of gems, and find a random item. For every seven days, you are able to access a shop where you can buy and sell items. There is a final boss at the end of the game that **requries** good items to defeat.


How-to-launch:
1. Run the latest version in terminal using "javac Woo.java && java Woo".
2. Follow the prompts given.
